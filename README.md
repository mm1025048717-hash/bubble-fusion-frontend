# Bubble Fusion Lab – AI-Powered Idea Fusion  

🚀 **Bubble Fusion Lab** is a new way to **think, organize, and create**.  
We turn your ideas into visual **bubbles** — and when you drag two bubbles together, they **fuse** into something new, powered by **AI**.

## ✨ Why Bubble Fusion?
- **Visual First** – Every idea is a bubble. Organize, drag, and connect them.  
- **AI-Powered Fusion** – Drop two bubbles together, and AI suggests a new title & insights instantly.  
- **Multi-format Support** – Manage text, images, videos, docs, audio.
